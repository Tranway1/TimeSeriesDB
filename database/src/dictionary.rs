/* 
 * Changes: removed is_implmented and implement method from dictionary
 *		Wanted to decouple dictionary from the method
 */

/* 
 * Overview:
 * This is the API for the dictionary iplementation. This is broken
 * into two parts.
 * 1. The dicitionary tracker which keeps track of a mapping
 * 	  from an Id to the dicitionary. Currently, This will
 *    likely interact with a dicitionary buffer to extract it.
 *    This enables a lightweight method for compressed signals to 
 *    keep track of the dictionary used in the process if one was used
 * 2. The dictionary which unlike the tracker is not a trait, but
 *    a structure. The reason for making this a structure was that 
 *    	(1) I do not forsee much change in the dictionary or a 
 *			need for mutiple implementations
 *      (2) Allowing multiple dicitionaries complicates memory
 *          management and so on as they aren't uniform. So 
 *          heap allocation, Box, would be required to handle this.
 *    The dictionary should provide all necessary features that any 
 *    future compression method or exisiting compression method will
 *    require.
 *
 * Design Choice:
 * Mainly discussed above, but the tracker is a trait as it doesn't
 * increase code complexity much and allows for easier revision and
 * implementation of new designs.
 *
 * Current Implementations:
 * I have made one basic stuctures that theroertically could 
 * implement the tracker traits as well the base for the dictionary 
 * structure
